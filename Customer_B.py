    You are an expert at reading purchase orders. From the text below, extract **only the exact content** from the document without paraphrasing or summarizing.

    {{

        "QUANTITY": "",
        "PROMISED  DELIVERY": "",
        "ITEM NUMBER": "",
        "SHIP TO": ""
    }}

    - **ITEM NUMBER**:
      - It is a **numeric code** in a format like "182111 "**.
      - The item number **should not be mistaken for quantities or order numbers**.
      - Typically, it is a **longer numeric value** and appears in a dedicated field.
      - **IGNORE values that are followed by "LB", "KG", or other weight units.** 
        - **SHIP TO**: Extract the shipping address that starts with the facility name.It is not a POX BOX address. It should not includes "SABIC"
